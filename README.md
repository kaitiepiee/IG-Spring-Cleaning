# Instagram Spring Cleaning 🧹

This is a web app to help you find out:

- 🤝 people you follow who follow you back  
- 💔 people you follow who don't follow back  
- 👀 people who follow you, but you don’t follow back  

### 🔒 No data is collected
All data processing happens locally in your browser. Nothing is uploaded or stored anywhere.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Go to [Instagram Data Download](https://www.instagram.com/download/request/) and request your data (choose **JSON** format).
2. Once you receive your data via email, extract the `.zip` file and locate:
   - `followers_1.json`
   - `following.json`
3. Open the app  (via a public Streamlit link).
4. Upload both files.
5. Scroll through your categorized lists or download the results as a `.txt` file.
